This repository contains a curated selection of code samples, project excerpts, and technical artifacts from my professional work as a software developer. The goal is to demonstrate how I approach problems, structure code, design systems, and communicate technical ideas, rather than to provide fully deployable applications.

I’m happy to walk through any project, file, or design choice during an interview, discuss trade-offs, or dive deeper into specific areas of interest such as scalability, performance, testing, or maintainability.

This repository is intended as a conversation starter and a transparent look into how I write and reason about code.
